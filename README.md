# Duma

A simple, clean word-of-the-day app. 

* Uses the Wordnik API to get the word, its definition and pronunciation (if there is one!)
* Clicking on the word takes you to its dictionary.com page (if there is one!)
* Has a series of beautiful backgrounds provided by Unsplash 

**Why "Duma"?**<br>
Дума (duma) means word in Bulgarian. I thought it was quite catchy!

**You can also get it as a Chrome Extension!**<br>
[Woohoo!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duma/mamoofifhahehmokjnkpdkoojkcliimc)
